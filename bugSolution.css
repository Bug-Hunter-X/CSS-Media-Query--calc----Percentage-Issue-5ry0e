The solution avoids using `calc()` and `%` within the media query condition:

```css
/* Using vw units (viewport width) */
@media (max-width: 900px) { /* Example width; adjust as needed */
  .element {
    width: 50%;
  }
}

/* Alternative: Removing calc() entirely */
@media (max-width: 900px) {
  .element {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

This approach utilizes a fixed pixel value (e.g., `900px`) in the media query.  You would adjust the pixel value based on your desired breakpoint. Using `vw` units is also a suitable alternative and would be responsive based on the viewport width.
